- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @erikobryant
I'm looking for people who would want to help me develope an intelligent operating system.
This would be an OS that has AI directly integrated into it to improve the user's experience.
The user would be able to tell their computer (in plain english) exactly what they wanted it to do and their request would be interpreted by an AI and executed.
I believe this could be the next step for AI, since it allows AI to take real world action to benefit its users.
Rather than generating suggestions or code, which the user would then have to implement themselves, this OS would have an AI that has access to your computer hardware.
It could find, make, and download files, optimize computer performance, cutomize your desktop, and do pretty much anything a person can do on a computer, but far faster and far more effectively.

All of the files for this operating system are in my Epoch repository, if you want to contribute, please message me at erockthefrog@gmail.com
